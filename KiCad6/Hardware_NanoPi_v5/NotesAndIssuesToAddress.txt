SY6280 alternative as power switch?

VBUS: capacitor and resistor etc are/seem different between nextthing and axp209 example
APS: capacitor 4.7uF in nextthing, 0.2uF in axp209 example


N_VBUSEN: Added pulldown, if NanoPi sets pulls high at any point* power might be cut if no battery is connected.
Since we normally have a battery it probably wouldn't be an issue anyway, but could use <32kOhm pull down instead
to ensure <= 0,8V.
*the processor default value is high impedance but maybe operating systems set other during boot up
