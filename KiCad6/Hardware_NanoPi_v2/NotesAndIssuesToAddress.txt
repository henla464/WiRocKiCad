VCC-5v: how to shut it off when in power off mode?

SY6280 alternative as power switch?

USB0-DRV says if power should be supplied to micro usb. This happens when
it is in OTG mode. The U10 (LPW 5210B5F) is enabled to supply power
from VCC-5V to micro usb and N_VBUSEN is set to high so that VBUS is not
selected to supply power to IPSOUT.

=> Probably skip OTG function



VBUS: capacitor and resistor etc are/seem different between nextthing and axp209 example
APS: capacitor 4.7uF in nextthing, 0.2uF in axp209 example

Add current limiter to USB Host?


N_VBUSEN: Added pulldown, if NanoPi sets pulls high at any point* power might be cut if no battery is connected.
Since we normally have a battery it probably wouldn't be an issue anyway, but could use <32kOhm pull down instead
to ensure <= 0,8V.
*the processor default value is high impedance but maybe operating systems set other during boot up


i2c pull-ups: does it need to be added or is it provided already by nanopi or the alwinner processor
